Mine ore to train your ![Mining](/assets/images/skills/mining.png) [Mining](/skills/mining.html) skill and gather materials for smithing.

### 3. Smith Better Equipment
Take your ores to a furnace to smelt bars, then use an anvil to forge weapons and armor. Better equipment means easier combat! See ![Smithing](/assets/images/skills/smithing.png) [Smithing](/skills/smithing.html) for details.
