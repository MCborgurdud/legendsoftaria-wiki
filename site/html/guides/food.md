# Food

**Food** is consumable items that restore ![Health](/assets/images/skills/health.png) health when eaten. The primary source of food in Legends of Taria is cooked fish, which are obtained through ![Fishing](/assets/images/skills/fishing.png) [Fishing](/skills/fishing.html) and ![Cooking](/assets/images/skills/cooking.png) [Cooking](/skills/cooking.html).

## How Food Works

- Tap on food in your inventory or hotbar to eat it
- Each food item restores a specific amount of health
- You cannot eat while your health is full
- Eating has a short cooldown between uses
- Always carry food when venturing into dangerous areas!

## Cooked Fish

Cooked fish are the main healing items in the game. Raw fish must be cooked at a campfire before they can be eaten.

## Obtaining Food

### Fishing and Cooking

The most common way to obtain food:

1. Get fishing equipment (net, rod, cage, or harpoon) - see ![Fishing](/assets/images/skills/fishing.png) [Fishing](/skills/fishing.html)
2. Catch raw fish from fishing spots
3. Cook the raw fish at a campfire - see ![Cooking](/assets/images/skills/cooking.png) [Cooking](/skills/cooking.html)
4. Eat the cooked fish to restore ![Health](/assets/images/skills/health.png) health

### Buying from Shops

Some NPCs sell food items. Check shops in major towns.

## Tips

- **Stock up before combat**: Always have a full inventory of food before fighting tough enemies
- **Match food to content**: Higher level content requires better food
- **Cook in bulk**: Use the batch cooking feature to cook many fish at once
- **Keep food in your hotbar**: Quick access to food can save your life in combat
