# ![Defense](/assets/images/skills/defense.png) Defense

**Defense** is a combat skill that reduces the damage you take from enemy attacks. A higher Defense level makes you harder to hit and lets you equip better armor.

## How Defense Works

Your Defense level affects:
- **Evasion**: Higher levels reduce the chance enemies will successfully hit you
- **Armor Requirements**: Better armor requires higher Defense levels

## Gaining Experience

You gain Defense XP when enemies deal damage to you. The more damage you take, the more Defense XP you earn. However, training other combat skills typically gives XP in their respective skills rather than Defense.

## Defensive Equipment

Armor provides defensive bonuses that stack with your Defense level. Armor is typically crafted through [Smithing](/skills/smithing.html).
