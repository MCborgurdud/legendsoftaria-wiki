# ![Health](/assets/images/skills/health.png) Health

**Health** (also called Hitpoints or HP) is a combat skill that determines how much damage you can take before dying. Every player starts with a Health level that increases as they take damage in combat.

## How Health Works

Your maximum HP is directly tied to your Health level. At level 1, you have a small health pool. As your Health level increases, you can survive more damage.

## Gaining Experience

You gain Health XP passively through combat. When you deal damage to enemies or take damage from them, you earn Health XP alongside your combat skill XP.

## Restoring Health

### Food

The primary way to restore health is by eating [Food](/guides/food.html). Cooked fish are the most common healing items - see the [Food](/guides/food.html) page for a complete list of all food items and their healing values.

### Natural Regeneration

Your health slowly regenerates over time when out of combat.

## Death

If your health reaches zero, you die. Upon death:
- You respawn at a safe location
- Check the game for specific death penalties

## Training Tips

1. **Stay in combat**: Health XP comes from active combat, not sitting idle
2. **Fight enemies your level**: Balance risk and reward for steady training
3. **Always carry food**: Never venture out without healing supplies
4. **Watch your health bar**: Eat before your health gets critically low

## Combat Level

Health is one of the combat skills that determine your overall Combat Level, along with Melee and Defense.
