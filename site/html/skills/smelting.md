# ![Smithing](/assets/images/skills/smithing.png) Smelting

**Smelting** is the process of converting raw ores into metal bars at a furnace. Bars are then used in [Smithing](/skills/smithing.html) to craft weapons and armor.

## Getting Started

To smelt bars, you need ores in your inventory and access to a furnace. Tap on the furnace to open the smelting interface, then select which bars you want to smelt.

## Smelting Recipes

All bars are smelted at a furnace.

## Furnace Locations

Furnaces can be found in various locations throughout the world. Look for them near:
- Mining areas
- Towns with smithing facilities
- Industrial districts

## Training Tips

1. **Mine your own ores**: Combine Mining and Smelting training for efficiency
2. **Smelt in batches**: Queue up multiple bars to save time
3. **Upgrade as you level**: Move to higher-tier ores for better XP rates
4. **Bank near furnaces**: Store ores near a furnace for quick smelting runs
