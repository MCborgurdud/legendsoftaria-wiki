# ![Melee](/assets/images/skills/melee.png) Melee

**Melee** is a combat skill that determines your effectiveness with melee weapons like swords. Higher Melee levels increase your accuracy and maximum damage in close-quarters combat.

## How Melee Works

Your Melee level affects:
- **Accuracy**: Higher levels mean you hit more often
- **Maximum Hit**: Higher levels increase the maximum damage you can deal

## Gaining Experience

You gain Melee XP by dealing damage to enemies with melee weapons. The amount of XP gained is based on the damage dealt.

## Combat Mechanics

### Attack Roll
Your chance to hit is calculated using:
- Your Melee level
- Your weapon's attack bonus
- The defender's Defense level
- The defender's defensive bonuses

### Damage Roll
When you hit, damage is calculated using:
- Your Melee level
- Your weapon's strength bonus
- A random roll between 1 and your max hit

## Melee Weapons

Melee weapons are typically crafted through [Smithing](/skills/smithing.html). Higher tier weapons provide better attack and strength bonuses.

## Training Tips

1. **Start with weak enemies**: Begin training on low-level creatures near the spawn area
2. **Keep food handy**: Cook fish to restore health during extended training
3. **Upgrade your weapon**: Better weapons mean faster kills and more XP per hour
4. **Check your Defense**: Balance Melee and Defense training for survivability

## Combat Style

Melee has a range of 1.25 tiles, requiring you to be close to your target.

## Combat Level
