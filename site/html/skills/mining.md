# ![Mining](/assets/images/skills/mining.png) Mining

**Mining** is a gathering skill that allows players to extract ores from rocks scattered throughout the world. Ores can be smelted into bars at a furnace, which are then used in [Smithing](/skills/smithing.html) to create weapons and armor.

## Getting Started

To begin mining, you'll need a pickaxe equipped in your hotbar. Approach a rock and tap on it to start mining. Your success chance depends on the rock type, your Mining level, and the quality of your pickaxe.

## Training Tips

1. **Levels 1-10**: Mine [![Copper Ore](/assets/images/items/copper-ore.png) Copper](/items/copper-ore.html) and [![Tin Ore](/assets/images/items/tin-ore.png) Tin](/items/tin-ore.html) ore. These are abundant in the starting areas and respawn quickly.
2. **Levels 10-20**: Switch to [![Iron Ore](/assets/images/items/iron-ore.png) Iron](/items/iron-ore.html) ore for better XP. Iron rocks are slightly slower but give double the experience.
3. **Levels 20-30**: Mine [![Mithril Ore](/assets/images/items/mithril-ore.png) Mithril](/items/mithril-ore.html) ore. Make sure you have at least an [![Iron Pickaxe](/assets/images/items/iron-pickaxe.png) Iron Pickaxe](/items/iron-pickaxe.html).
4. **Levels 30+**: [![Adamant Ore](/assets/images/items/adamant-ore.png) Adamant](/items/adamant-ore.html) ore provides the best XP but requires a [![Mithril Pickaxe](/assets/images/items/mithril-pickaxe.png) Mithril Pickaxe](/items/mithril-pickaxe.html).
