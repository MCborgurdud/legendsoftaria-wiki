## Getting Started

To cook food, you need raw fish in your inventory and access to a campfire. Tap on the campfire to open the cooking interface, then select what you want to cook.

## Cooking Recipes

All fish are cooked at a campfire. Each recipe takes 3 seconds to complete.

## Training Tips

1. **Levels 1-15**: Cook [![Shrimp](/assets/images/items/shrimp.png) Shrimp](/items/shrimp.html), [![Anchovies](/assets/images/items/anchovies.png) Anchovies](/items/anchovies.html), and [![Sardine](/assets/images/items/sardine.png) Sardines](/items/sardine.html). These are abundant from early fishing spots.
2. **Levels 15-30**: Move on to [![Trout](/assets/images/items/trout.png) Trout](/items/trout.html), [![Bass](/assets/images/items/bass.png) Bass](/items/bass.html), and [![Salmon](/assets/images/items/salmon.png) Salmon](/items/salmon.html) for better XP.
3. **Levels 30-45**: Cook [![Crab](/assets/images/items/crab.png) Crabs](/items/crab.html), [![Lobster](/assets/images/items/lobster.png) Lobsters](/items/lobster.html), and [![Octopus](/assets/images/items/octopus.png) Octopus](/items/octopus.html).
4. **Levels 45+**: High-level fish like [![Swordfish](/assets/images/items/swordfish.png) Swordfish](/items/swordfish.html), [![Shark](/assets/images/items/shark.png) Shark](/items/shark.html), [![Manta Ray](/assets/images/items/manta-ray.png) Manta Ray](/items/manta-ray.html), and [![Tuna](/assets/images/items/tuna.png) Tuna](/items/tuna.html) give the best XP.

## Cooking Locations

Look for campfires throughout the world. Common locations include:
- Near fishing spots
- In towns and villages
- Player camp areas

## Batch Cooking

You can queue up multiple fish to cook at once. Select your recipe, choose a quantity, and your character will continue cooking until you run out of raw fish or cancel the action.

## Food and Health

Cooked fish restore varying amounts of health when eaten. Higher level fish generally heal more. Keep a supply of cooked food for combat!
